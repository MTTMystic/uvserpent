I'm @uvserpent (Anastasia R), currently a CS major at University of Illinois of Urbana-Champaign planning to graduate December 2021.
I'm primarily interested in developing web apps and video games (+ mods) with the overarching purpose of building software that enhances self-development and/or edifies the collective.
At the moment I'm exploring front-end web development by using the React + Redux toolchain to optimize and extend an existing in-browser demo of procedural terrain generation powered by WebGL 2.0. Among other amusements.
I'd be willing to collaborate on anything aligned with my interests as listed above.
